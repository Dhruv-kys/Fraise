"""Research MCP server — a planner designs the agents, then they fan out.

One voice command becomes N agents running at once, each on a different angle,
each summarizing its own slice. A synthesizer merges them into an artifact — a
doc or a slide deck — and the voice LLM speaks only a headline, because the
artifact is the answer and TTS is a bad way to read twenty search results.

The agents are NOT a fixed list. A planner decides them per question: ask about
internships and you get job boards; ask to compare electric cars and you get
reviews, pricing, and owner forums. Hardcoding sources would mean this only ever
worked for the one example it was built against.

Progress is published to `bus` as the plan lands and each agent moves, so the
browser renders them working in parallel rather than staring at a spinner.
